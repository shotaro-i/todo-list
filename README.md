# Todo List (Vanilla JS)

Simple, dependency-free todo app.

## How this project was built

- Learning project
- Initial skeleton generated with GitHub Copilot
- The rest was vibe-driven development with heavy AI assistance
- Every line was **reviewed, tested, and either kept with confidence or rewritten/deleted by me**  
  → The final code contains only what I'm confident in and take responsibility for
