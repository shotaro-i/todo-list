# Todo List (Vanilla JS) 

Simple, dependency-free todo app.

I created a prototype using AI, reviewed the code myself, and made modifications.

Features

- Add todos
- Toggle completed
- Edit by double-click or edit button ,or press enter or space when focused
- Delete
- Filter (All / Active / Completed)
- Clear completed
- Persists to `localStorage` (key `todos_v1`)

Open `index.html` in a browser to try.
